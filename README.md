# Here's a little bit about me

- Hi, I’m @Tshulkey
- I’m interested in software engineering, game development, machine learning, and AI.
- I’m currently learning computer science at CSULB. I'm also learning Thai in my free time.
- I have a lot more projects that I've worked on at school that is not on here due to my fear of being in trouble since some professors don't want their assingments getting out.
